## File Naming Convention
Snake case with no capital letters or spaces. Instead of spaces use underscores to 
seperate words. (ex: this_file.txt)

## Coding Conventions
### Naming
- Variables should be snake case with all lowercase letters. (ex: my_var)
- Functions should be camel case with the fist letter lowercase. (ex: thisFunc())
- Classes and structures should be camel case with the first letter capitalized. (ex: ThisClass)

### Formating
- Tabs should be configured to be four spaces.
- Function definitions should have curly braces on a new line. ex:

        void myFunc()
        {
            // Do something.
        }
